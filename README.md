# Overview

In this project, I developed a To-do List application to demonstrate my understanding of the JavaScript language. The software allows users to add, edit, and complete tasks, as well as view their tasks in different lists. The primary purpose of this project was to enhance my skills in JavaScript programming and gain practical experience in building interactive web applications.

The To-do List application showcases various JavaScript language features, including DOM manipulation, event handling, array manipulation, and local storage usage. Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript syntax and improve my ability to implement dynamic and user-friendly web interfaces.
